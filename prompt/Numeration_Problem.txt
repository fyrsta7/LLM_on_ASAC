Here is an algorithm competition problem. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. Don't use the bits/stdc++.h library. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format.**Numeration Problem**

**Problem Description**

Try to calculate how many times the number x (0≤x≤9) occurs in all integers from the interval 1 to N (n\<=1000000). For example, from 1 to 11, that is, in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, the number 1 occurs four times.

**Input**

There is one line containing two integers n and x, separated by a space.

**Output**

There is one line containing one integer, representing the number of occurrences of x.

**Sample Input**

11 1

**Sample Output**

4
