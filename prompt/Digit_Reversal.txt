Here is an algorithm competition problem. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. Don't use the bits/stdc++.h library. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format.**Digit Reversal**

**Problem Description**

Given an integer, reverse each digit of the number to get a new number. The new number should also satisfy the common form of integers, that is, the highest digit of the new number obtained after the reversal should not be zero unless the given original number is zero.

**Input**

An integer N (−1,000,000,000≤N≤1,000,000,000).

**Output**

An integer, representing the new number after reversal

**Sample Input**

123

**Sample Output**

321

**Hint**

**Sample Input 2**

-380

**Sample Output 2**

-83
