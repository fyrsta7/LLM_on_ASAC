Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: L;
int: S;
int: T;
int: M;
array[1..M] of int: stones;
array[1..L] of var 0..L: steps;
var 1..L: step_num;
var int: ans;
set of int: stone_set = array2set(stones);
constraint steps[1] = 0;
constraint steps[step_num] >= L;
constraint forall(i in 1..step_num-1)(steps[i+1] - steps[i] <= T /\ steps[i+1] - steps[i] >= S);
constraint ans = card(stone_set intersect array2set(steps));
solve minimize ans;
output[show(ans)];
