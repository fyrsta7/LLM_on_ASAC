Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: a;
int: b;
var int: x;
constraint x > 0;
constraint (a * x) mod b = 1;
solve minimize x;
output[show(x)];
