Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: N;
int: m;
array[1..m,1..3] of int: items;
array[1..m] of var 0..1: choose;
var int: ans;
constraint forall(i in 1..m)(if choose[i]=1 then (if items[i,3]!=0 then choose[items[i,3]]=1 endif) endif);
constraint sum([if choose[i]=1 then items[i,1] else 0 endif | i in 1..m]) <= N;
constraint ans=sum([if choose[i]=1 then items[i,1] * items[i,2] else 0 endif | i in 1..m]);
solve maximize ans;
output["\(ans)"];
