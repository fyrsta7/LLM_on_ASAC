Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: T;
array[1..T] of int: n;
int: sum_n = sum(n);
array[1..sum_n] of int: a;
array[1..T] of int: begin_n = [sum(j in 1..i-1)(n[j]) | i in 1..T];
array[1..T] of int: max_n = [sum(j in begin_n[i]+1..begin_n[i]+n[i])(a[j]) | i in 1..T];
int: bound = max(max_n);
array[1..sum_n] of var int: b;
constraint forall(i in 1..T)(forall(j in begin_n[i]+1..begin_n[i]+n[i])(b[j] >= 1 /\ b[j] <= max_n[i]));
