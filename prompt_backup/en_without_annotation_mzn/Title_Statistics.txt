Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

string: title;
int: title_length = string_length(title);
var int: answer;
constraint answer = sum(i in 1..title_length where title[i] != " ")(1);
solve satisfy;
output [show(answer)];
