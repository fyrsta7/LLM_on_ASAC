Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: n;
int: m;
array[1..n] of int: color;
array[1..n] of int: number;
var int: total;
var int: res;
constraint total == sum(i in 1..n) (sum(j in i+1..n) (sum(k in j+1..n) (if color[i] == color[k] /\ k-j==j-i then (i+k)*(number[i]+number[k]) else 0 endif)));
constraint 0 <= res /\ res <= 10006;
constraint (total - res) mod 10007 == 0;
solve satisfy;
output ["\(res)"];
