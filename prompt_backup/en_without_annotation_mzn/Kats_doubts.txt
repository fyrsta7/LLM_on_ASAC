Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: a;
int: b;
int: max_ans = 2000;
var 1..max_ans: ans;
constraint forall(i in 2..min(a, b)) ((a mod i != 0) \/ (b mod i != 0));
constraint forall(num_a, num_b in 0..max_ans)(ans != num_a * a + num_b * b);
solve maximize ans;
output[show(ans)];
