Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: a;
int: b;
int: k;
int: n;
int: m;
var int: coefficient;
function var int: combinatorial(var int: n, var int: k) =
  factorial(n) div (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k));
function var int: factorial(var int: num) =
  if num == 0 then 1
  else factorial(num - 1) * num
  endif;
constraint coefficient = (combinatorial(k, n) * pow(a, n) * pow(b, m)) mod 10007;
solve satisfy;
output[show(coefficient)];
