Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: n;
int: x;
function var int: appear_times(var int: num, var int: a) =
if num < 10 then (num == a)
else appear_times(num div 10, a) + ((num mod 10) == a)
endif;
var int: ans;
constraint ans = sum(i in 1..n)(appear_times(i, x));
solve satisfy;
output[show(ans)];
