Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

array[1..10] of int: apple;
int: h;
var int: num;
constraint num = count([apple[i] <= h + 30 | i in 1..10]);
solve satisfy;
output [show(num)];
