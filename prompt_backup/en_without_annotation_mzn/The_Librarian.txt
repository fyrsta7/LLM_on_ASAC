Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: n;
int: q;
array [1..n] of int: index;
array [1..q] of int: reader_token;
array [1..q] of int: reader_bit;
array [1..q] of var 1..n+1: object;
predicate fit(var int: book_id,int: reader_id)=
   book_id==n+1 \/ (index[book_id] mod  pow(10,reader_bit[reader_id]))== reader_token[reader_id];
constraint forall(i in 1..q)(fit(object[i],i)/\ forall(k in 1..n)(not (fit(k,i) /\ (object[i]==n+1 \/ index[k]<index[object[i]]))));
solve satisfy;
output["\(if object[i]<n+1 then index[object[i]] else -1 endif)\n"|i in 1..q];
