Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: w;
int: n;
array[1..n] of int: P;
array[1..n] of var 1..n: setIndex;
array[1..n] of var int: weight;
array[1..n] of var int: num;
weight = [sum([P[j] | j in 1..n where setIndex[j] == i]) | i in 1..n];
num = [sum([1 | j in 1..n where setIndex[j] == i]) | i in 1..n];
var int: object = sum([1 | number in num where number > 0]);
constraint forall(number in num)(number <= 2);
constraint forall(mass in weight)(mass <= w);
solve minimize object;
output["\(object)"];
