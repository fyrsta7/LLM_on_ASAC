Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: T;
int: M;
array[1..M, 1..2] of int: herb;
array[1..M] of var 0..1: index;
var int: total;
var int: cost;
total = sum([herb[j, 2] * index[j] | j in 1..M ]);
cost = sum([herb[j, 1] * index[j] | j in 1..M ]);
constraint cost <= T;
solve maximize total;
output[show(total)];
