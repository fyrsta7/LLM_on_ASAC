Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: N;
int: m1;
int: m2;
array[1..N] of int: S;
int: max_T = 10000;
int: M = pow(m1, m2);
array[1..N] of var 1..max_T: time;
constraint forall(i in 1..N)(time[i] = arg_min(t in 1..max_T)(pow(S[i], t) mod M == 0));
var int: ans = min(time);
solve minimize ans;
output[if fix(ans) == max_T then "-1" else show(fix(ans)) endif];
