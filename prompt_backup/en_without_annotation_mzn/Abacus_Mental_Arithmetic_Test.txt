Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: n;
array [1..n] of int: data;
set of int: ans = { i | i, j, k in data where i = j + k /\ j != k };
solve satisfy;
output[show(card(ans))];
