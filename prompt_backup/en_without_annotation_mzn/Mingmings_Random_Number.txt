Here is an algorithm competition problem described in MiniZinc. Please provide a correct C++ program for this problem and ensure that the program's complexity is as low as possible. The answer should include only the C++ program. Don't add explanation outside the program. Don't use markdown format. 

int: n;
array[1..n] of int: random;
var set of 1..1000: random_set;
var 1..n: num;
constraint random_set = array2set(random);
constraint num = card(random_set);
array[0..n] of var int: out;
constraint forall(i in 1..num)(out[i] in random_set);
constraint forall(i in 1..num-1)(out[i] < out[i+1]);
solve satisfy;
output[show(num) ++ "\n"];
output["\(out[i]) " | i in 1..fix(num)];
